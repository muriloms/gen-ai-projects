## ðŸš€ Practical Projects

Here is a curated list of practical projects that showcase the applications of Generative AI across different fields. Each project includes code, documentation, and examples to facilitate understanding and experimentation.

- [**Project 1: Text Generation with Transformers**](https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-repo/tree/main/projects/text-generation)  
  Build a text generator using transformer models, with applications in creative writing and automated responses.

- [**Project 2: Image Synthesis with GANs**](https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-repo/tree/main/projects/image-synthesis)  
  Create synthetic images using GANs, with experiments on style transfer and domain-specific image generation.

- [**Project 3: Music Composition with VAEs**](https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-repo/tree/main/projects/music-composition)  
  Generate music compositions using Variational Autoencoders, exploring the intersection of AI and the creative arts.
